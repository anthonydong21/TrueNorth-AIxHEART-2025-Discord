## Poetry Setup

Create a local virtual environment with Poetry using
```
 poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
Then, `cd` into the directory that contains pyproject.toml and poetry.lock. Install the poetry environment with this terminal command:
```
poetry install
```
Now you can update your virtual environment that Poetry made:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Environment Setup
You need an `.env` file with these values set up:
```
export GEMINI_API_KEY="something"
export DB_CONNECTION= "postgresql+psycopg://something"
export DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PROJECT="something"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
...
```

...check out `.env.example` for a file you can copy.

# Setup
# You need to preprocess and embed PDFs into the vectorstore:

```python Knowledge.py```

This will take 20+ minutes if you have several PDFs. After you have converted your books to vectors and uploaded them to the PostreSQL database.

# Launch Chatbot API
This sets up a server that the Streamlit application can send calls to.
```poetry run uvicorn HerVoice.src.app:app --reload```

# Launch the Streamlit webpage
You need to have the above chatbot API launched in another terminal before running:
```streamlit run HerVoice.py```
